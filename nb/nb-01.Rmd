## Practice: Running R Code

In this notebook are some further practice questions to see how well you
understood the material from today.

In the code block below, make a variable named `fav_number` and set it
equal to your favorite number. (Note, the quotes are not part of the
variable name).

```{r, question-01}

```

In the code below, apply the function `log10` to your favorite
number. (Again, the quotes are not part of the function name).

```{r, question-02}

```

Note that the only point of the exercises here are to familiarize
you with running code in R, creating variables, and applying functions.
We will get to more interesting tasks soon!
