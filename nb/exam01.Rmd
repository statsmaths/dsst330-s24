This is just some space to use to compute the results for the
take-home exam. You can see the solutions to notebook 7 for 
some helpful hints. Please do not hand this file in. I need the
handwritten results on the page I handed out in class (or 
printed copy if you lost the one I gave you)

```{r}
x <- c()
y <- c()
```

In case it's helpful, you could organize your code by the 
questions on the sheet. But again, entirely up to you.

```{r, question-01}

```

```{r, question-02}

```

```{r, question-03}

```

```{r, question-04}

```

```{r, question-05}

```

```{r, question-06}

```

```{r, question-07}

```

```{r, question-08}

```

```{r, question-09}

```
