This is just some space to use to compute the results for the
take-home exam. Please do not hand this file in. I need the
handwritten results on the page I handed out in class (or 
printed copy if you lost the one I gave you)

For the first set of questions, you could input it by filling
in the four values here that I have set all to zero:

```{r}
tab <- matrix(c(0,0,0,0), ncol = 2)
tab
```

And for the linear regression, here is a dataset that you could
use by filling in the corresponding values of x and y.

```{r}
df <- tibble(
  x = c(),
  y = c()
)
df
```
