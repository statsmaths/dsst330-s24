{\LARGE Exam 02: Study Guide}

\vspace*{18pt}

\noindent
The exam has two parts with equal weights, an open-notes
take-home part and a closed-notes in-class part.

\vspace*{18pt}

\noindent
The take-home
portion will consist of a small data collection exercise and
data analysis where you apply one or more of the techniques that
we have learned so far. You are welcome to use R (and I will 
even provide a short template to get you started), but you
can also do the calculations by hand. The only part you hand
in will be a paper with a short description and your results.
I will distribute the instructions at the end of class on Wednesday.

\vspace*{18pt}

\noindent
The in-class exam will have 4 questions, all four taken directly
from worksheets 9 and 10. These are all questions that ask you
to compute the MLE estimator of a parameter or a formula for
$\Lambda$ for the log-likelihood ratio test.
