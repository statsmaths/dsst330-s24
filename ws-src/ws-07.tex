% QUESTION

Consider a sample of size $6$ with the following values: $0$, $1$, $5$, $7$, $12$.
What are the sample mean and sample variance $\bar{X}$ and $S^2_X$?

% x <- c(0, 1, 5, 7, 12)
% var(x)

% SOLUTION

The sample mean is $5$ and the sample variance is $23.5$.

% QUESTION

Consider collecting data from two populations. We collect $n=25$ observations
from the first group, with sample mean $7$ and sample variance $9$. From the 
second group, we have $m=30$ samples and a mean of $4$ with a sample variance
of $4$. What is the pooled variance $S^2_p$?

% SOLUTION

The sample mean is $5$ and the sample variance is $23.5$.

% QUESTION

Using the data from above, construct a $99$\% confidence interval for the 
difference in the means. You can use the fact that $t_{0.99/2}(54) = 2.67$. 

% qt(1 - 0.01/2, df = 54)

% SOLUTION

% QUESTION

Using the data from above, run a hypothesis test to see if the samples have the
same variance with a $99$\% confidence level. Use the fact that
$f_{0.99/2}(24, 29) = 2.76$ and $f_{1-0.99/2}(24, 29) = 0.347$. 

% qf(1 - 0.01/2, df1 = 24, df2 = 29)
% qf(0.01/2, df1 = 24, df2 = 29)
