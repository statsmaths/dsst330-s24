\textbf{(Regression I)} Consider a completely different task, where we start
with a set of fixed real values $x_1, \ldots, x_n$. We observe a random
sample of independent observations $Y_1, \ldots, Y_n$, where
$Y_i \sim N(b \cdot x_i, \sigma^2)$.\footnote{
  In these questions, $y_i$ will be play the role that we have previously
  been calling $x_i$. This is the unquestioned standard notation for regression,
  so I wanted to use it even though it requires a bit of translation work.
} So, the observations are independent but not identically distributed (they
have different means). What is the log-likelihood of the sample?

\textbf{(Regression III)} Consider an hypothesis test with $H_0: a = 0$. 
Using the results we established the first few weeks (that is, without using the
log-likelyhood test), find a pivot statistic to test this hypothesis.

\textbf{(MLE)} Let $X_1, \ldots, X_n \iid Uniform(0, a)$. Find the MLE estimator
for $a$. Note: You cannot do this using the derivative. Just think about it!
