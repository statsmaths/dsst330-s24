The Pareto distribution is a distribution with two parameters:
$x_m>0$ and $\alpha > 0$. It has a pdf equal to zero for values of $x < x_m$
and a pdf equal to $\frac{\alpha x_m^\alpha}{x^{\alpha + 1}}$ for $x > x_m$.
If $\alpha > 1$, the expected value of the Pareto is given by
$\frac{\alpha x_m}{\alpha - 1}$. Consider a prior distribution where $\theta$
has a Pareto distribution with parameters $x_m=0$ and $\alpha > 0$ with a
likelihood having a density $X|\theta \sim U(0, \theta)$.
Find (a) the prior distribution and (b) the Bayesian point estimator for $\theta$.
