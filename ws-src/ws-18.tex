% QUESTION

Consider a prior distribution where $\lambda \sim Gamma(\alpha, \beta)$ and a 
likelihood $X_j|\lambda \sim Poisson(\lambda)$ for an i.i.d. sample of size $n$.
Find (a) the prior distribution, (b) the Bayesian point estimator, and (c) the
limit of the point estimator when the data dominates the prior.

Assume you have a sample of size $n = 10$ from a Poisson distribution. The 
average of the data is $\bar{x} = 3$. What are the (a) MLE estimator of $\lambda$,
(b) the Bayesian estimator of $\lambda$ with a $Gamma(1, 1)$, and (c) the
Bayesian estimator of $\lambda$ with a $Gamma(10, 1)$?\footnote{
  Take a moment to compare the results and see how the relate the means of the
  two priors.
