% QUESTION

Consider a simple linear regression where we know that $b_0 = 0$. You can write
$b_1 \rightarrow b$ to simplify the notation. Write down the likelihood function
for the sample. Do not yet simplify.

% QUESTION

Now, (a) compute the log-likelihood function and simplify. (b) Without doing any
calculus (that is, just looking at the function), maximizing the log-likelihood
with respect to $b$ is equivalent to minimizing what quantity in terms of $y_i$,
$x_i$, and $b$? Note: Ask me about the correct solution before proceeding.

Take the derivative of the quantity that you had in part (b) from the previous
question with respect to the parameter $b$. Set this equal to zero to get the 
MLE.

% QUESTION

Go back to the full log-likelihood function. Take the derivative with respect
to $\sigma^2$ (remember, this is a single parameter, not the square of a parameter).
Set this to zero and solve to get the MLE of $\sigma^2$.
