% QUESTION

Assume we have a random sample of size $n = 5$ with the following data:
$x_1 = 2$, $x_1 = 6$, $x_1 = 1$, $x_1 = 0$, $x_1 = 6$. What is the observered
sample mean $\bar{x}$? 
\footnote{
  I am using the standard convention that we replace upper-case random 
  variable names with lower-case variables when we have specific 
  observations of them. 
}

% SOLUTION

We have:
\begin{align*}
\bar{x} &= \frac{2 + 6 + 1 + 0 + 6}{5} = \frac{15}{5} = 3.
\end{align*}

Let $X_1, \ldots, X_n \iid \mathcal{G}$ be a random sample from a distribution
with mean $\mu_X$ and variance $\sigma^2_X$. What is the expected value of the
sample mean $\bar{X}$?\footnote{
  I gave the answer on the handout. Make sure that you can justify
  the result.
} Does this imply that $\bar{X}$ is an unbiased estimator of $\mu_X$?

% QUESTION

Using the same set-up as the previous question, what is $Var(\bar{X})$?

% QUESTION

Let $Y$ be a random variable with mean $m$ and variance $v$. Chebyshev's
Inequality tells us that if for any $a > 0$,
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}[ |Y - m| \geq a] \leq \frac{v}{a^2}.
\end{align*}
Use this result to show that $\bar{X}$ is a consistent estimator of $\mu_X$.

% QUESTION

Assume that $\mathcal{G}$ has a normal distribution. Define the following:
\begin{align*}
Z &= \frac{\mu_X - \bar{X}}{\sqrt{\sigma_X^2 / n}}
\end{align*}
What is the distribution of Z?
