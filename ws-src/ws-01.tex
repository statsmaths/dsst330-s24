% QUESTION

We will give more formal definitions later, but for now
define a probability of an event to be a number between 0 and 1 that
indicates how likely an event would be to happen. For example, a
value of 0 indicates that it will never happen, a value of 1 that it
will always happen. This matches the way that the word `probability' is
colloquial used in a non-technical context. While in casual conversatoin
most people refer to the number as a percentage or fraction, it will
be good to start thinking of them as decimals. Given this, give approximate
values for the probability of the following events:

\begin{itemize}[\label={}]
  \tightlist
  \item {(a)} A randomly selected M\&M will be blue.
  \item {(b)} A randomly selected car in Virginia is electric.
  \item {(c)} A randomly selected book starts with the word `The'.
  \item {(d)} An NBA basketball player will make a free throw.
  \item {(e)} A pregnancy results in having twins.
  \item {(f)} A clover will be a four-leaf clover.
  \item {(g)} A letter will be lost by the U.S. postal service.
  \item {(h)} Someone born in the U.S. in the year 2000 is named Taylor.
\end{itemize}

% SOLUTION

\noindent
[Any reasonable answers are fine. I've included values for some of the
answers that I found online, but I would not say that these are definitive.]

\begin{itemize}[\label={}]
  \tightlist
  \item {(a)} \textbf{A randomly selected M\&M will be blue.} 0.189
  \item {(b)} \textbf{A randomly selected car in Virginia is electric.} 0.0027
  \item {(c)} \textbf{A randomly selected book starts with the word `The'.} ?
  \item {(d)} \textbf{An NBA basketball player will make a free throw.} 0.7--0.8
  \item {(e)} \textbf{A pregnancy results in having twins.} 0.0001
  \item {(f)} \textbf{A clover will be a four-leaf clover.} 0.0001
  \item {(g)} \textbf{A letter will be lost by the U.S. postal service.} 0.03
  \item {(h)} \textbf{Someone born in the U.S. in the year 2000 is named Taylor.} 0.0003
\end{itemize}
