Consider a random sample $X_1, \ldots, X_n \sim N(\mu_X, \sigma^2_X)$. 
Write a test statistic to test the null hypothesis that $H_0: \sigma^2 = 4$.
Write down the exact form of the rejection region for a confidence level 
$(1 - \alpha)$.

Consider a two-sample design with the notation in Handout 5, with the assumption
of normality and equal variances. Write a test statistic to test the null
hypothesis that $H_0: \mu_X - \mu_Y = 0$. Write down the exact form of the
rejection region for a confidence level  $(1 - \alpha)$.
