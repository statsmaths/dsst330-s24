% QUESTION

Consider a random sample $X_1, \ldots, X_n \sim N(\mu_X, \sigma^2_X)$. 
Write a test statistic to test the null hypothesis that $H_0: \mu_X = 4$.
Write down the rejection region for a confidence level 
$(1 - \alpha)$. 

% SOLUTION

The test statistic will be:
\begin{align*}
T &= \frac{\bar{X} - 4}{\sqrt{S^2_X / n}}
\end{align*}
It will have a T-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom. This gives
a rejection region of:
\begin{align*}
R &= \{ |T| > t_{\alpha/2} \}
\end{align*}

% QUESTION

Consider a two-sample design with the notation in Handout 5, with the assumption
of normality and equal variances. Write a test statistic to test the null
hypothesis that $H_0: \mu_X - \mu_Y = 0$. Write down the
rejection region for a confidence level  $(1 - \alpha)$.

% SOLUTION

The test statistic will be:
\begin{align*}
T &= \frac{\bar{X} - \bar{Y}}{\sqrt{S^2_p \cdot \left[ \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{m} \right]}}
\end{align*}
It will have a T-distribution with $n + m - 2$ degrees of freedom. This gives
a rejection region of:
\begin{align*}
R &= \{ |T| > t_{\alpha/2} \}
\end{align*}

% QUESTION

Consider a two-sample design with the notation in Handout 5, with the assumption
of normality. Write a test statistic to test the null
hypothesis that $H_0: \sigma_X^2 = \sigma_Y^2$. Write down the
rejection region for a confidence level  $(1 - \alpha)$.

% SOLUTION

The test statistic will be (you can transpose the $\sigma_Y^2$
and $\sigma_X^2$ as long as you swap the degrees of freedom as
well).
\begin{align*}
F &= \frac{\sigma_Y^2}{\sigma_X^2} \sim F(n-1, m-1)
\end{align*}
The rejection region will be:
\begin{align*}
R &= \{ F < f_{1-alpha/2} \} \cup \{ F > f_{\alpha/2} \}.
\end{align*}
